HELLO!
This is my very first app I've created. It's not perfect but it's a proof of concept!
The purpose of this app is to help immigrants fill out documents using AI.
How this works is my having a user input a prompt regarding a form they want to fill out,
then the AI (Agent) uses the User's response to generate a response with the tools it's been provided.
Then the AI displays it's response to the front end where the user can see.

The tool I've provided the AI is only a few documents that are stored in vectors in a mongoDB database.
The Agent uses A RAG system to cross examine the user input with the documents provided, then creates the
best response it can. Or atleast that's my understanding. A lot of this technical terminology is foregin 
to me. But I tried the best I can!

Many thanks to the wonderful people at Urban TXT who helped me through SEALS, I couldn't have done it without you! <3
Special thanks to Bryan! Who was absolutely awesome in helping me in my struggles!

LETS MAKE HISTORY!
